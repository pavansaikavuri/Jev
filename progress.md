## 1. Executive Overview & Purpose

### 1.1 What is QuizZy?
**QuizZy** is a zero-cost, multi-model AI quiz assistant and automated solver designed for high-stakes online assessment and learning environments (such as `learning.ccbp.in`, Canvas, Moodle, and Coursera). It bridges an ultra-low-profile **Chrome Manifest V3 Extension** running in the browser with an asynchronous, local **FastAPI Inference Server** running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 1.2 The Problem It Solves
Online quiz platforms deploy complex front-end frameworks (React, Vue, Web Components), dynamic option randomization (shuffling option letters and order between attempts or students), and aggressive anti-tamper / proctoring scripts (MutationObservers, blur listeners, full-screen detectors, DOM alteration checks). Furthermore:
- **LLMs frequently hallucinate or rush to answer** combinatorics, probability, or mathematical equations if forced to immediately output an option letter.
- **Commercial AI APIs cost money.** QuizZy operates under a strict **$0 API budget**, utilizing free-tier allowances across multiple model families.
- **Latency matters.** Waiting 5 to 10 seconds per question causes test timeouts. QuizZy achieves a **sub-3-second p95 latency** on live LLM calls and **sub-10ms latency** on cache hits.
- **Automated bots fail on controlled inputs.** Standard `.click()` calls in JavaScript do not trigger React 16–18 synthetic event loops or update internal controlled component state, causing blank or incorrect submissions.

### 1.3 High-Level Solution
QuizZy solves these challenges through:
1. **Three decoupled layers:** Client DOM $\leftrightarrow$ Chrome MV3 Shadow DOM / Content Scripts $\leftrightarrow$ Local Python FastAPI backend.
2. **Order-invariant SQLite cache** with dynamic runtime permutation remapping.
3. **Multi-model consensus** using parallel racing of independent model families (Groq S-Tier models + Hedged OpenRouter fallbacks + SearXNG factual grounding).
4. **Zero DOM Mutation Extractor** operating entirely on cloned DOM trees.
5. **Mandatory Pre-Submit Selection Verification Gate** that verifies option selection before ever triggering form submission.
6. **Discreet HUD** featuring a compact rectangular bar and an ultra-small 9px movable white dot with keyboard double-tap controls.

## 2. Core Engineering Invariants

QuizZy is governed by six immutable architectural invariants:

### Invariant 1: Zero DOM Mutation
The quiz question extractor (`extension/extractor.js`) executes in read-only memory on cloned DOM fragments. It injects **zero classes, zero wrapper divs, and zero data-attributes** into the host page's question container. Proctoring tripwires (such as `MutationObserver` or DOM tree checksums) observe absolutely zero modifications during extraction.

### Invariant 2: Reason-First Calculation & Zero "UNCERTAIN" Consensus
- Word permutations (e.g., `"ARRANGE"`) and Bayes theorem calculations cause single models to diverge when rushed. The backend prompt enforces **reason-first derivation**: character frequencies, factorials ($7! / (2! \times 2!) = 1260$), or probabilities must be written inside the `"reason"` field **before** populating the `"answer"` key.
- Primary calls dispatch Model A (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`) and Model B (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`) in parallel on Groq. If they disagree, a Groq Arbiter and a hedged OpenRouter fallback pool race simultaneously.
- If fallbacks timeout or return 429, the system deterministically rescues using the surviving primary S-tier candidate as `MEDIUM_TIEBREAKER_AGREE`. The solver **never returns `UNCERTAIN` or `null`** when at least one model succeeded.

### Invariant 3: Order-Invariant Dynamic Cache (`backend/cache.py`)
- Shuffled options across quiz attempts produce identical canonical cache keys by sorting and hashing canonical option texts (`SHA-256`).
- When a cache hit occurs on a scrambled question, the cached canonical target text is dynamically resolved against the *current live permutation* of options, returning the exact live index in $< 10\text{ms}$.
- **Zero-Poison Guarantee:** Low-confidence or unverified answers are strictly barred from the database. Any user feedback flagging an answer as wrong triggers instant cache eviction and entry into `wrong_answers`.

### Invariant 4: Mandatory Pre-Submit Selection Verification Gate (`extension/executor.js`)
In automated quiz mode, clicking an option and immediately clicking Submit is catastrophic if React did not register the change. QuizZy takes a DOM snapshot before click, fires a full synthetic event cascade (`pointerdown` $\rightarrow$ `mousedown` $\rightarrow$ `mouseup` $\rightarrow$ `click` $\rightarrow$ `change`), and verifies that the option became checked or active. If verification fails, it retries via inner elements and `elementFromPoint`. If still unverified, **Auto Mode hard-aborts, refuses to click Submit, and outlines the correct answer for manual human review.**

### Invariant 5: Two-Step Progression (SUBMIT $\rightarrow$ NEXT)
Quiz platforms separate answering from navigation. The executor implements a stateful two-step flow:
1. Click option and verify state change.
2. Wait 220ms for React state commit.
3. Click `SUBMIT` / `CONFIRM` / `CHECK`.
4. Poll the DOM for the `NEXT QUESTION` button or question transition, verifying advancement.

### Invariant 6: Strict $0 API Budget & Self-Healing Rotation
The backend maintains multiple API keys across Groq and OpenRouter. HTTP 429 errors trigger an automatic 45-second quarantine for that specific key; HTTP 401/403 triggers a 300-second quarantine. Round-robin rotation distributes load evenly without spending a penny.

### 3.2 Breakdown of In-Flight Modifications (Working Directory)
The following files contain crucial hardening updates currently active in the working tree:

| File | Nature of Change | Purpose / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `backend/core/normalizer.py` | Math & Fraction Equivalence Parser | Adds `parse_math_numeric_value()` supporting LaTeX `\frac{a}{b}`, standard fractions `a/b`, percentages `50% -> 0.5`, and decimals. Matches mathematically equivalent options (e.g. `1/18` matches `2/36`). Handles option prefixes like `Option D: 2/36` or `Choice B`. |
| `backend/core/prompts.py` | Prompt Precision Hardening | Instructs models to verify calculations internally without emitting raw `<think>` tags, returning pure compact JSON with calculation inside `"reason"` first. |
| `backend/core/llm_client.py` | Consensus & Tiebreaker Racing | Parallel racing between Groq Arbiter and Hedged OpenRouter fallback pool. Single primary survival rescue prevents "UNCERTAIN" status. Per-key 429 quarantine (45s) and 401/403 quarantine (300s). |
| `extension/extractor.js` | Leaf Deduplication & Row Container Resolution | Adds `getElementCssPath()`, `deduplicateOptionElements()`, and `resolveOptionRowRoot()`. Excludes buttons/footers and resolves each option to its distinct row container, preventing misclicks on nested React DOM trees. |
| `extension/executor.js` | Pre-Submit Verification Gate & Event Cascade | Takes DOM snapshot, fires full pointer/mouse cascade, verifies selection. Implements fallback retry and hard-aborts before Submit if selection cannot be confirmed. |
| `extension/floating_hud.js` & `extension/sidepanel.js` | Hard-Abort Handlers & Highlight Fallback | When `executor.js` returns `selected: false`, Auto Mode instantly stops with `STOPPED_SELECTION_FAILED` and highlights the target option on screen for the student. |
| `models.json` | Timeouts & Catalog Tuning | Updated Groq timeout (2000ms), OpenRouter fallback timeout (2200ms), and hard budget (4000ms). |
| `backend/run_server.py` | Windows Pythonw Guard | Untracked entry point that guards against Windows Win32 `_multiprocessing.pyd` DLL architecture mismatch and redirects output to `server.log` under windowless execution. |
| `launch_backend_silent.vbs` | Windowless Launcher | Silent double-click shortcut launching the supervisor with zero command-line flicker. |
| `tests/test_bugfix_selection_and_consensus.py` | Regression Test Suite | 5 new automated tests verifying React selection cascade, leaf option deduplication, math fraction equivalence, and single primary rescue. |

### 4.1 Backend Engine (`backend/`)
- **`app.py`**:
  - FastAPI application entry point with CORS allowlists for Chrome extensions.
  - Endpoints: `POST /solve`, `GET /health`, `GET /stats`, `POST /feedback`.
  - Integrates `save_or_update_question_csv()` for automatic deduplicated storage of evaluated questions into `questions.csv`.
- **`cache.py`**:
  - Thread-safe SQLite storage (`backend/quizzy_cache.db`) operating under WAL mode.
  - Implements `compute_cache_key()`: sorts normalized option strings alphabetically before hashing with SHA-256. Regardless of how the host page randomizes options, the cache key remains identical.
  - Dynamic Index Remapping: given cached answer text `"Mitochondrion"`, maps it to the live index in the incoming request's current permutation ($< 10\text{ms}$).
  - Zero-Poison Filter: low-confidence (`LOW_FALLBACK`) or uncertain solutions are barred from entering the cache.
- **`core/llm_client.py`**:
  - Dispatches parallel requests to Primary Model A (`openai/gpt-oss-120b`) and Primary Model B (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b`) over distinct API keys.
  - Manages round-robin rotation across multiple Groq and OpenRouter keys.
  - Implements per-key quarantine on HTTP 429 (45s) and HTTP 401/403 (300s).
  - Parallel Hedged Tie-Breaker: when primaries disagree, dispatches both Groq Arbiter and OpenRouter hedged fallback pool simultaneously using `asyncio.wait(return_when=FIRST_COMPLETED)`.
  - Single Primary Rescue: if one primary fails or fallbacks 429, safely rescues the valid primary result as `MEDIUM_TIEBREAKER_AGREE`.
- **`core/normalizer.py`**:
  - Normalizes text with Unicode NFKC, strips leading articles, punctuation, and decorative prefixes (`Option D: ...`, `Choice B`, `(A)`).
  - Implements `parse_math_numeric_value()`: evaluates fractions, decimals, LaTeX expressions, and percentages, establishing mathematical equivalence.
- **`core/prompts.py`**:
  - Formulates the system and user prompts with strict reason-first derivation order and output formatting instructions.
- **`core/searxng_client.py`**:
  - Evaluates questions for factual eligibility (history, geography, biology) while excluding pure math or code.
  - Sanitizes web snippets inside an `<untrusted_search_context>` envelope to mitigate prompt injection.
  - Circuit breaker trips after connection errors and fails open in $< 5\text{ms}$ so the system never hangs if SearXNG is offline.

### 4.2 Chrome Extension (`extension/`)
- **`manifest.json`**: Manifest V3 compliant, minimal permissions (`sidePanel`, `activeTab`, `scripting`, `storage`, `tabs`), zero persistent background scripts, zero externally exposed web resources.
- **`floating_hud.js`**:
  - Injected inside a closed Shadow DOM to avoid CSS pollution or detection.
  - Offers two display modes:
    1. **Compact Rectangular Bar:** Sleek slate bar (`36px` height, dark `#111827`, subtle border and shadow) showing answer, confidence pill, and controls.
    2. **Movable White Dot:** Ultra-compact `9px x 9px` white dot with a dark border and expanded transparent drag area. Can be placed anywhere on screen and saves coordinates to `chrome.storage.local`.
  - Hotkeys: Double-tap `Ctrl` (Show/Hide), Double-tap `Z` or `Alt` (Toggle Dot/Bar), Double-tap `Shift` or `Fn` (Toggle Auto Mode), `Escape` (Emergency Kill Switch).
- **`extractor.js`**:
  - Clones question containers before parsing.
  - Strips UI noise, navigation headers, and validation messages ("Please select an option").
  - Preserves LaTeX formulas and multi-line code indentation.
  - Deduplicates leaf option elements and resolves option root rows up to the individual question item container.
- **`executor.js`**:
  - Implements the React synthetic event cascade (`pointerdown` $\rightarrow$ `mousedown` $\rightarrow$ `mouseup` $\rightarrow$ `click` $\rightarrow$ `change`) and overrides property descriptors for React-controlled radio buttons.
  - Enforces the Mandatory Pre-Submit Verification Gate: verifies the option state actually changed before signalling success.
  - Simulates drag-and-drop for sequence ordering questions.
- **`sidepanel.js` & `sidepanel.html`**:
  - Diagnostic sidebar displaying live model confidence, SearXNG sources, manual solve buttons, wrong-answer feedback reporting, and auto-solve progress.

### 4.3 Background Daemon & Windows Autostart (`scripts/`)
- **`backend/run_server.py`**: Python entry point guarding against Windows multiprocessing DLL bugs and redirecting standard output to `backend/server.log`.
- **`scripts/keep_backend_alive.ps1`**: Background supervisor script running a 5-second health loop. Automatically restarts the backend if it crashes, recovers after laptop sleep/wake cycles, and rotates logs exceeding 5MB.
- **`scripts/launch_backend_hidden.vbs`**: Executes the PowerShell supervisor with window style `0` (completely hidden, zero taskbar appearance).
- **`launch_backend_silent.vbs`**: Root shortcut for users to double-click and launch the backend invisibly.
- **`scripts/install_autostart.ps1`**: Registers the silent launcher in Windows Startup (`shell:startup`) and creates a Windows Scheduled Task (`QuizZyBackendSupervisor`) triggered on user logon.

## 6. Errors, Mistakes & Technical Bugs Encountered

During development, verification, and regression audits, several subtle bugs were identified and fixed. Below is a detailed teardown of each mistake, why it occurred, and how it was resolved:

### 6.1 Test Suite Quarantine Crosstalk (Gemma 429 Model Pollution)
- **The Symptom:** Running `pytest tests/test_phase6_multikey_hedged_fallback.py` in isolation succeeded with 7/7 passes. However, running the entire test directory (`pytest -v`) caused 3 test failures in Phase 6:
  - `test_1_non_chat_model_rejection`: `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free` was unexpectedly missing from healthy models.
  - `test_3_parallel_hedged_tiebreaker_early_exit`: returned `B` instead of `A`.
  - `test_4_dual_primary_failure_rescued_by_fallback_consensus`: returned `LOW_FALLBACK` instead of `MEDIUM_TIEBREAKER_AGREE`.
- **The Root Cause:** In `test_phase1_api.py` and `test_phase3_automode.py`, live or simulated network requests were made without mocking `call_model_with_budget_retry`. When an external model throttled or timed out, `llm_client.py` called `quarantine_model("google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-it:free", 60.0)`, writing to the module-level dictionary `_model_quarantine_until`. Because Phase 6 only reset key quarantines (`reset_key_quarantine()`) and did not reset model quarantines, Phase 6 executed with Gemma quarantined, skewing candidate pools and tiebreakers.
- **The Fix:** Added an `autouse=True` pytest fixture in `tests/test_phase6_multikey_hedged_fallback.py` that invokes both `reset_key_quarantine()` and `reset_model_quarantine()` before and after every single test.

### 6.2 Errant Asyncio Runner Wrapping in Phase 4 Direct CLI
- **The Symptom:** Running `python tests/test_phase4_searxng.py` directly from the terminal crashed with:
  ```text
  ValueError: a coroutine was expected, got None
  ```
- **The Root Cause:** In `tests/test_phase4_searxng.py`, `test_3_disagreement_rescued_by_searxng()` and `test_4_circuit_breaker_and_offline_fail_open()` were defined as regular synchronous functions (`def`), which internally handled their own async calls via `asyncio.run()`. However, the runner block `run_all_phase4_tests()` erroneously wrapped them in `asyncio.run(test_3_...)`. Pytest discovered and ran them directly without hitting this runner block, masking the issue.
- **The Fix:** Removed the redundant `asyncio.run()` wrappers from `run_all_phase4_tests()`, calling them directly as synchronous functions.

### 6.3 Premature Form Submission on Unverified React Radio State Updates
- **The Symptom:** On complex React learning portals (`learning.ccbp.in`), Auto Mode occasionally submitted questions without selecting an answer, resulting in zero points.
- **The Root Cause:** Dispatching a vanilla DOM `.click()` on a custom-styled `<input type="radio">` or its `<label>` does not update React's internal fiber node state if the component is controlled and listening for `pointerdown` or `change`. The executor assumed the click succeeded and immediately fired the `SUBMIT` button before the state committed.
- **The Fix:** 
  1. Created `capturePreClickSnapshot()` to record checked status, active classes, and ARIA attributes of all options.
  2. Implemented `triggerReactSelection()` which fires the entire input event sequence (`pointerdown` $\rightarrow$ `mousedown` $\rightarrow$ `mouseup` $\rightarrow$ `click` $\rightarrow$ `change`) and overrides property descriptors via `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'checked').set`.
  3. Added `verifyOptionSelected()`: if the snapshot indicates no state change, it retries clicking inner children and `elementFromPoint`.
  4. Added **Hard Abort Rule**: if selection cannot be confirmed, `executeQuizAction` returns `{ ok: false, selected: false, error: 'OPTION_SELECTION_FAILED' }`. The HUD stops Auto Mode immediately, refuses to click Submit, and visually highlights the target option for the user.

### 6.4 Leaf Option Duplication and Container Mis-Targeting
- **The Symptom:** On nested question cards, `extractor.js` matched both parent wrapper containers and child text nodes, resulting in an options array with 8 elements for a 4-option question, causing validation errors.
- **The Root Cause:** Generic query selectors (e.g. `div[class*="option"]`) matched nested hierarchies where both the container and inner text elements contained the class.
- **The Fix:** Implemented `deduplicateOptionElements()` to strip elements whose ancestors are already in the list, and built `resolveOptionRowRoot()` which traverses up the DOM to find the exact per-option row container while stopping before the multi-option card root.

### 6.5 Mathematical Fraction Representation Mismatches
- **The Symptom:** In probability questions, when options were `["1/36", "2/36", "3/36", "4/36"]` and the model answered `"1/18"`, the normalizer raised `NormalizationError: Unable to normalize MCQ answer '1/18'`.
- **The Root Cause:** The normalizer only performed string equality and substring searches. Mathematically, $2/36 = 1/18 = 0.0556$, but as strings they never match.
- **The Fix:** Added `parse_math_numeric_value()` in `backend/core/normalizer.py`. It parses standard fractions, LaTeX `\frac{num}{den}`, percentages, and floats. When string matching fails, it computes numeric equivalence ($|val_{ans} - val_{opt}| < 10^{-6}$), correctly resolving `"1/18"` to the `"2/36"` option.

### 6.6 Windows Pythonw Multiprocessing DLL Crash
- **The Symptom:** Starting the backend silently via `pythonw.exe` on Windows caused an immediate silent crash.
- **The Root Cause:** Python's standard `multiprocessing` library attempts to import `_multiprocessing.pyd`, which expects standard Win32 console handles. Under `pythonw.exe` (windowless), `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` are `None`, causing unhandled exceptions in Uvicorn's worker processes.
- **The Fix:** Created `backend/run_server.py`, which injects a dummy `_multiprocessing` stub if missing, safely redirects `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to `backend/server.log` and `server.err.log`, and launches Uvicorn directly without child process spawning.

## 9. Phase 9 Hardening: Three Core Question Models (100% Zero-Error Target)

Implemented and strictly verified across live `learning.ccbp.in` question models (October 2026):

### 9.1 Model 1: Drag-and-Sequence Questions ("Drag and Drop to Order")
- **Order Requirement:** Sequence must follow the exact chronological/logical order stated in the problem (e.g. Linear Probing collision resolution: `1. Check if the calculated index is already occupied` -> `2. If occupied, move to the next slot (index + 1)` -> `3. Repeat until an empty slot is found`).
- **DOM & Drag Simulation (`extension/executor.js`):**
  - Handles `react-beautiful-dnd` drag handles (`[data-rbd-drag-handle-draggable-id]`, `::` handles) via keyboard accessibility sequences (`Space` to lift, `ArrowDown`/`ArrowUp` steps, `Space` to drop).
  - Simulates coordinate-based pointer/mouse movements and native HTML5 DragEvents (`dragstart`, `dragenter`, `dragover`, `drop`, `dragend`).
  - **Mandatory Pre-Submit Order Verification:** Compares post-drag DOM item order against `ordered_texts`. Returns `ok: false, error: 'ORDER_VERIFICATION_FAILED'` if elements fail to reorder, completely blocking incorrect automatic submissions.

### 9.2 Model 2: Multiple-Choice Questions with Several Correct Answers (Square Checkboxes)
- **Check-Square Requirement:** Square option indicators (`[role='checkbox']`, `input[type='checkbox']`, square indicator elements).
- **Multi-Select Normalizer & Solver (`backend/core/normalizer.py`, `backend/schemas.py`, `backend/cache.py`):**
  - Added native `q_type: "multi"` support with `canonical_keys` (e.g. `["A", "D"]`), `selected_indices` (e.g. `[0, 3]`), and `selected_texts` (e.g. `["Uses a second hash function", "Reduces clustering"]`).
  - Strict independent True/False evaluation for all options to avoid single-option truncation errors.
  - Zero-error grading rejects partial matches (`grade_answer` returns `False` if only one of multiple correct options is selected).
- **Execution & Pre-Submit State Gate (`extension/executor.js`):**
  - `isOptionChecked`: evaluates native inputs, ARIA attributes (`aria-checked="true"`), checkmark SVG icons, and class state.
  - `executeMultiMcqAction`: toggles every target option on, toggles non-target options off, and verifies every option state matches target before returning `ok: true`.

### 9.3 Model 3: Fill-in-the-Box Questions (Numerical / Text Inputs)
- **Input Targeting (`extension/extractor.js`, `extension/executor.js`):**
  - Prioritizes question-specific input textareas/inputs with placeholders such as `Enter your answer` or `answer`.
  - Dispatches full React native property descriptor setter and `input` / `change` events.
  - **Pre-Submit Input Verification:** Confirms `inputEl.value === expected` before returning `ok: true`.
  - Deterministic mathematical calculation rules added to system prompt (e.g. multiplication hashing $h(123) = \lfloor 10 \cdot (123 \cdot 0.618 \bmod 1) \rfloor = 0$).

### 9.4 Floating HUD Stale State Elimination (`extension/floating_hud.js`)
- Added `resetSolutionDisplay()` triggered upon:
  1. Next / Advance button click.
  2. Question signature transition during Auto Mode.
  3. Start of solve extraction.
- Prevents previous question's badges (e.g. `[D]`) or reasoning from persisting across question transitions.
- Added dynamic multi-select badge `[A, D]` and ordered sequence arrow display `➔`.

### 9.5 Verification Results
- `tests/test_three_question_models.py`: 8/8 unit and integration tests passing.
- Full pytest test suite (`tests/`): 57/57 tests passing in 24.5s with zero regressions.
- Offline deterministic self-test (`eval/run_eval.py --self-test`): 8/8 tests passing (100% success).
- Live server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/solve`: verified all 3 models returning 100% accurate responses.

## 10. Phase 7 Final Completion: End-to-End Coding Solve, Deep Problem Reasoning & Forensic Self-Healing Engine

### 10.1 Deep Problem Reasoning & Forensic Self-Healing Prompts (`backend/core/prompts.py`)
- **Mode 1 (First Attempt):** Formulates step-by-step problem analysis, algorithm/data structure justification, and concrete example walkthrough inside the `reason` field. Requires explicit handling of critical edge cases (`head == NULL`, `head->next == NULL`, empty inputs, all-negative values, 0-based vs 1-based indexing, 64-bit integer overflow). Preserves exact starter signatures in `answer` without duplicating driver headers or platform declarations.
- **Mode 2 (Second Attempt Forensic Repair):** Automatically activates when `error_context` is supplied. Injects Attempt 1's code and compiler stderr / runtime traceback / failed testcase diagnostics. Requires an explicit 3-step root-cause diagnosis in `reason` before emitting complete, repaired source code in `answer`, strictly forbidding repeating Attempt 1's broken implementation.
- **Contract & Guardrails:** Enforces `CODING_SYSTEM_PROMPT` with `/no_think` enforcement, stripping `<think>` tags and guaranteeing single valid JSON output.

### 10.2 Backend Cache Bypass & Cache Self-Healing (`backend/app.py`, `backend/cache.py`, `backend/schemas.py`)
- **Automatic Cache Bypass on Retry:** `/solve` detects `request.bypass_cache or bool(request.error_context)` and bypasses `solve_cache` on read, ensuring Attempt 1's failed code is never re-served on Attempt 2.
- **Cache Self-Healing on Verified Retry:** When Attempt 2 reaches consensus (`HIGH_BOTH_AGREE` or `MEDIUM_TIEBREAKER_AGREE`), `solve_cache` is updated via `INSERT OR REPLACE`, healing the cache entry for that problem.
- **Zero-Poison Invariant:** Unverified, uncertain, or failing responses are strictly forbidden from being written to the cache.
- **Token & Timeout Headroom:** Verified `max_tokens: 2048` and sufficient timeout headroom for code generation in `models.json` and `backend/core/llm_client.py`.

### 10.3 Language, Problem & Unfolded Starter Code Extraction (`extension/extractor.js`)
- **`detectCodingLanguage(docRef, starterCodeHint)`:** Multi-tier language detection resolving `cpp`, `python`, `java`, or `javascript` from DOM selectors (`select`, `combobox`, toolbar buttons), Monaco/Ace editor mode IDs, and syntax signatures (`#include`, `def `, `public class`, `function`).
- **`extractCodingProblem(docRef)`:** Non-mutating extractor capturing problem title, description, constraints, and sample testcases (`Input`, `Output`, `Explanation`), differentiating Coding Playground from split-pane MCQs.
- **Unfolded Starter Code:** Extracts folded comment structures (`/* struct Node ... */`) and function signatures directly from Ace/Monaco editor sessions.

### 10.4 Compiler/Testcase Drawer Parser & DOM Epoch Synchronization (`extension/executor.js`)
- **`capturePreRunSignature(docRef)`:** Captures snapshot of output console text and child count prior to clicking Run.
- **`triggerRunButton(btn)`:** Full pointer and mouse event dispatch sequence (`pointerover`, `mouseover`, `pointerdown`, `mousedown`, `focus`, `pointerup`, `mouseup`, `click`) with safe single fallback click.
- **`pollOutputConsole(timeoutMs, docRef, preRunSignature)`:** Epoch-synchronized polling that ignores stale Attempt 1 error DOM nodes until in-flight compiling or text mutation occurs.
- **`extractCodingExecutionResult(docRef, attemptCode)`:** Structured extraction of `PASSED`, `COMPILATION_ERROR` (line references and stderr), `RUNTIME_ERROR` (exception and traceback), and `WRONG_ANSWER` (`Input`, `Your Output`, `Expected Output`), assembling structured `error_context`.

### 10.5 Unified End-to-End Solve Workflow & Bounded Self-Healing Loop (`extension/background.js`, `extension/executor.js`, `extension/sidepanel.js`)
- **Unified Solve Orchestration:** Clicking **Solve** or pressing `Alt+S` in Coding Mode executes the complete lifecycle:
  `IDLE → IDENTIFYING → EXTRACTING → GENERATING → WRITING → RUNNING → VERIFYING → (RETRYING → GENERATING → WRITING → RUNNING → VERIFYING) → COMPLETED/FAILED`.
- **Bounded Retry (`max_retries = 1`):** Terminates cleanly as `FAILED` if Attempt 2 fails, preventing infinite loops.
- **Strict Production Guardrail:** `isAuthorizedTestEnvironment()` returns `false` on `learning.ccbp.in`, ensuring `verified_no_submit_production_guardrail` and disabling automated submission on live assessment portals.
- **Concurrency Mutex:** `isCodingAutomationRunning` prevents duplicate triggers and is guaranteed to release in a `finally` block.

### 10.6 Phase 7 Comprehensive Verification Results
- **Full Pytest Test Suite (`tests/`):** **105/105 tests passing (100%)** across 17 test modules in 59s.
- **Self-Healing Complete Suite (`tests/test_phase7_self_healing_complete.py`):** **6/6 tests passing (100%)**.
- **Coding Automation Engine Suite (`tests/test_phase7_coding_automation_engine.py`):** **8/8 tests passing (100%)**.
- **Coding Benchmark Problems (`tests/test_phase7_coding_mode.py`):** **15/15 problems passing (100%)**.
- **Offline Deterministic Self-Test (`eval/run_eval.py --self-test`):** **8/8 tests passing (100%)**.
- **Live Model Catalog & Connectivity (`eval/run_eval.py --check-models`):** All Groq and OpenRouter models verified.
- **Realistic CCBP Coding Benchmark (`eval/run_eval.py --coding-benchmark`):** **15/15 problems passing (100%)**.

### 10.7 Letter-by-Letter Human Typing Engine Hotfix (Paste-Blocked CCBP Portal)
- **Problem Statement:** On `learning.ccbp.in`, paste events (`Ctrl+V`, right-click paste, or `ClipboardEvent('paste')`) are strictly blocked by the portal's security policies. Moreover, setting `.value` on Monaco's hidden `<textarea class="inputarea">` does not update Monaco's internal model or React state, causing the runner to compile unmodified starter code (`//Write Your Code Here...`), resulting in `Time Limit Exceeded`.
- **Root-Cause Analysis:**
  1. `autoCompileAndSubmitLoop` was executed in the Chrome Extension `ISOLATED` world where `window.monaco` was not directly accessible, falling back to writing to the hidden textarea which Monaco ignored.
  2. `writeCodeWithHumanTypingInMainWorld` was calling `setValue()` which acted as a bulk replacement rather than real keystrokes, missing `keydown`, `keypress`, `beforeinput`, and `keyup` event sequences.
- **Architectural Solution:**
  1. **Background Step 3b MAIN-World Bridge:** In `extension/background.js`, Step 3b now explicitly executes `writeCodeWithHumanTypingInMainWorld` in `world: "MAIN"` via `chrome.scripting.executeScript` immediately after obtaining the solution and before entering the compilation loop.
  2. **True Letter-by-Letter Typing Engine:**
     - Disables auto-closing brackets (`autoClosingBrackets: "never"`) and auto-indent in Monaco and Ace to prevent duplicate brackets (`{{}}`) or mangled indentation.
     - Clears the buffer cleanly via `monacoEditorInstance.executeEdits("type-clear", ...)` or `setValue("")`.
     - Types every single character sequentially:
       - Monaco: `monacoEditorInstance.trigger("keyboard", "type", { text: ch })` for each letter.
       - Ace: `aceInstance.onTextInput(ch)` or `aceInstance.insert(ch)` for each letter.
       - Textarea / inputarea: Dispatches `keydown`, `keypress`, `document.execCommand("insertText", false, ch)` / `InputEvent("input", { inputType: "insertText", data: ch })`, and `keyup` for each character.
       - Dispatches zero `paste` events and zero clipboard events.
     - Verifies final buffer, performs atomic reconciliation if needed, and calls React Fiber's `onChange`.
  3. **Executor MAIN-World Bridge on Retries (`writeCodeToMainWorld`):** Added `writeCodeToMainWorld` helper in `extension/executor.js` that dispatches `WRITE_CODE_EDITOR_MAIN` to the background worker to ensure Attempt 2 self-healing retries are also typed letter-by-letter in the MAIN world.
- **Verification:** All 105 pytest tests passing in 63.6s, with 100% pass rates on `test_3_paste_blocked_ace_and_monaco_human_typing_engine` and `test_4_compile_and_run_self_healing_retry_and_submit_loop`.

### 10.8 Critical Hotfix: Non-Paste MAIN-World Code Writer, React Fiber Discovery & Pre-Run Verification Gate
- **Problem Statement:** In coding mode on platforms like `learning.ccbp.in/question/*`, QuizZy was clicking **Run** without writing the generated code into the editor, causing `Time Limit Exceeded` or compilation errors on unmodified starter code.
- **Root Causes Eliminated:**
  1. **Isolated World vs. MAIN World Execution Mismatch:** Content scripts running in the `ISOLATED` world lacked direct access to `window.ace`, `window.monaco`, `aceEl.env.editor`, and React Fiber tree.
  2. **Hidden Keystroke-Catcher `<textarea>` False Positive:** When global editor objects were absent in the isolated world, fallbacks matched `.ace_text-input` or `textarea.monaco-mouse-cursor-text` and mutated `.value`, which does not update the underlying Ace `EditSession` or Monaco `ITextModel`, while falsely returning `{ success: true }`.
  3. **Missing Post-Write Read-Back Verification Gate:** The loop transitioned immediately from `WRITING` to `RUNNING` without verifying that the editor's live buffer actually changed.
  4. **Webpack-Bundled React Editors & Blocked Paste Events:** `learning.ccbp.in` blocks `paste` events and wraps Monaco/Ace inside React components where React state (`onChange`) must be synchronized via non-paste operations (`executeEdits("keyboard", ...)` / `session.doc.setValue`).
  5. **Pre-Write Code Payload Ordering:** `TRIGGER_CODING_AUTO_LOOP` was previously entered without waiting for or verifying a valid non-empty code payload.
- **Surgical Implementations:**
  1. **Multi-Layer Non-Paste Editor Discovery & Writing Engine (`discoverMainWorldEditor`):**
     - Monaco: `win.monaco.editor.getEditors()`, `win.monaco.editor.getModels()`, DOM expandos, and deep React Fiber traversal (up to 16 hops on `__reactFiber$` / `__reactInternalInstance$` / `__reactProps$`) finding `executeEdits`, `getModel`, `setValue`, `pushEditOperations`, and `onChange`.
     - Ace: `aceEl.env.editor`, `aceEl.editor`, `aceEl.__ace_editor__`, `win.ace.edit(aceEl)`, and deep React Fiber scan finding `session`, `getValue`, `setValue`, and `onChange`.
     - CodeMirror 5 (`getValue`/`setValue`) & CodeMirror 6 (`view.state.doc.toString()` / `view.dispatch()`).
     - **Requirement B Hard Rule:** If `.ace_editor`, `.monaco-editor`, `.CodeMirror`, or `.cm-editor` is in DOM, strictly refuses to mutate internal hidden focus textareas (`.ace_text-input`, `textarea.inputarea`) and returns `{ success: false, error: "Editor container found but MAIN-world editor instance was not accessible" }`.
  2. **Service Worker MAIN-World Routing:**
     - Content scripts dispatch `WRITE_CODE_EDITOR_MAIN` and `READ_CODE_EDITOR_MAIN` via `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` to `extension/background.js`, which executes them in `world: "MAIN"` via `chrome.scripting.executeScript`.
  3. **Pre-Run Read-Back Verification Gate (Requirement D):**
     - QuizZy strictly verifies that `writtenResult.success === true`, `readBackBuffer.length > 0`, buffer is not identical to untouched starter stub, and contains key code lines/tokens before clicking Run.
     - Retries once with alternative mutation if unverified. If still unverified, sets state to `FAILED`, aborts immediately with `write_verification_failed`, and guarantees `runClickCount === 0`.
  4. **End-to-End Solve Trigger Integrity & Code Pre-Resolution:**
     - `TRIGGER_CODING_AUTO_LOOP` and `TRIGGER_SOLVE` pre-resolve code from payload, storage, or backend `/solve`, strip markdown fences, write Attempt 1 to MAIN world, and execute the loop with self-healing retry callback.
- **Verification Suite:**
  - **Full Pytest Suite:** **110/110 passing (100%)** in 61s across all 18 test modules (including new tests 9-13 in `tests/test_phase7_coding_automation_engine.py`).
  - **All 15 Coding Benchmark Problems:** **15/15 passing (100%)** via `test_5_all_15_coding_benchmark_problems_end_to_end`.
  - **Offline Deterministic Self-Test:** **100% passing** via `eval/run_eval.py --self-test`.
  - **Realistic CCBP Coding Benchmark:** **15/15 passing (100%)** via `eval/run_eval.py --coding-benchmark`.

### 10.9 CCBP Monaco React Hook `useRef` Discovery, Boilerplate Preservation & Pre-Run Gate
- **Observed CCBP Bug:** On `learning.ccbp.in/question/4aac171a-80f5-4b42-a5db-bd0a8d1318ce` ("Verify if a Linked List Forms a Circle"), the starter stub contained `class Solution{ public: bool isCircular(Node* head) { //Write Your Code Here... } };`. QuizZy previously clicked Run on untouched code resulting in `Time Limit Exceeded`.
- **Root Causes Fixed:**
  1. **Monaco in React Hook `useRef`:** CCBP's `@monaco-editor/react` stores the Monaco editor in functional component hook chains (`hook.memoizedState.current`). Scanners looking directly at `memoizedState` missed it. Updated `scanReactFiber` and `discoverMainWorldEditor` with `checkCandidate(cand)` to unwrap `.current`, climb up ancestor elements (up to 15 hops) and fiber returns (up to 25 hops), scan RequireJS AMD modules (`require("vs/editor/editor.main")`), DOM expandos (`__monaco_editor__`, `editor`, `_editor`), and iframes.
  2. **Class-Wrapping & Boilerplate Preservation:** When the solver returns a function body (e.g. `bool isCircular(Node* head) { ... }`) without an enclosing class, `writeCodeWithHumanTypingInMainWorld` automatically wraps the solution inside `class ${currentClassName} { public: ... };` and splices it cleanly from `classIdx`, preserving all preceding comments (`#include`, `/* class Node ... */`) and keeping the closing `};` intact without syntax errors.
  3. **Strict Pre-Run Verification Gate (`verifyBufferContents`):**
     - Immediate rejection if `/write\s+your\s+code\s+here/i.test(buf)`.
     - Filters out lines from `starterStub` so boilerplate lines like `class Solution{` don't trigger false positives.
     - Strictly requires solution-specific tokens in the editor before allowing `CLICK_RUN`.
  4. **Sidepanel & HUD Wiring:**
     - Connected `codingHudInstance` methods (`apply`, `next`, `startAuto`, `stopAuto`) in `extension/floating_hud.js` to dispatch `TRIGGER_APPLY` and `TRIGGER_CODING_AUTO_LOOP`.
     - In `extension/sidepanel.js`, passed `language` and `starter_code` to `WRITE_CODE_EDITOR_MAIN` in `btnApplyCode` and `applySolutionAction`.
- **Automated Verification:**
  - Added Test 14 (React Fiber Hook `useRef` Editor Discovery), Test 15 (Post-Write Gate Rejection of Starter Placeholders), and Test 16 (Class-Wrapping Boilerplate Preservation) in `tests/test_phase7_coding_automation_engine.py`.
  - **Full Pytest Suite:** **113/113 passing (100%)** in 61s.
  - **CCBP Coding Benchmark:** **15/15 passing (100%)** in `eval/run_eval.py --coding-benchmark`.

### 10.10 Split-Pane Multi-Monaco Target Isolation & Empty Payload Reject Guard
- **Problem Statement (Observed Symptom on CCBP):**
  On CCBP coding pages (`learning.ccbp.in/question/*`), multiple Monaco editor instances coexist:
  1. An example output code snippet inside the left description pane (e.g. under "Example 1 Output:" in `.question-description`).
  2. The main interactive workspace code editor inside the right-hand black container.
  Previously, naive selectors (`doc.querySelector(".monaco-editor")`, `eds[0]`, or `models[0]`) targeted the first Monaco element found in DOM order, which happened to be the example output box on the left. Consequently, QuizZy wrote code (e.g. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` or `import sys`) into the left description pane's read-only snippet box while leaving the actual right-hand coding editor completely blank, triggering CCBP's orange alert: *"Write some code before running."*
- **Root Causes Eliminated:**
  1. **DOM Order vs Workspace Editor Mismatch:** The example snippet in the description pane appears first in DOM order and in Monaco's `getModels()` list (`models[0]`).
  2. **Snippet Read-Only Status:** The preview snippet has `readOnly: true`, whereas the interactive workspace editor has `readOnly: false`.
  3. **Empty/Whitespace Payload Vulnerability:** If a payload had empty code, `!targetCode && targetCode !== ""` evaluated to `false`, allowing an empty string to wipe the editor.
- **Surgical Implementations:**
  1. **`findMainEditorElement(docRoot)` (`extension/background.js`, `extension/executor.js`):**
     - Excludes elements inside `.question-description`, `.problem-statement`, `.problem-description`, `[class*='description']`, `[class*='instructions']`, `.testcase-output`, `[class*='console']`, and `[class*='output']`.
     - Measures rendered dimensions (`offsetWidth * offsetHeight`) and selects the candidate with the largest rendered area (the right-hand coding workspace is >400px tall and >500px wide, compared to ~50px tall snippet boxes).
  2. **Non-ReadOnly Editor & Attached Model Resolution (`background.js`, `executor.js`, `extractor.js`):**
     - Matches `eds` against `findMainEditorElement`.
     - Filters `eds` via `!e.getRawOptions().readOnly` and selects the workspace editor (`pool[pool.length - 1]`).
     - In `getModels()`, prioritizes attached models (`m.isAttachedToEditor()`) and falls back to `models[models.length - 1]`.
  3. **Strict Empty-Code Guardrail:**
     - Enforces `if (!targetCode || !targetCode.trim()) return { success: false, error: "Empty code payload rejected: refusing to wipe editor buffer" }` across both `background.js` and `executor.js`.
- **Verification Suite:**
  - **Full Pytest Suite:** **113/113 passing (100%)** in 61s across all 18 test modules.
  - **Phase 7 Coding Automation Engine Suite:** **16/16 passing (100%)**.
  - **Phase 7 Coding and Stealth Suite:** **6/6 passing (100%)**.
  - All contracts (`window.monaco.editor.getModels()`, `window.ace.edit`) preserved.
